### Course Info

* *Instructor:* [ Christian Kroer ](http://www.christiankroer.com)
* *Time:* Mondays & Wednesdays 1:10-2:25pm
* *Location:* 233 Mudd
* *Office hours:* Wednesday 2:25-3:30pm (or anytime; but email me first in that case)

### Course Summary
Economics, AI, and Optimization is an interdisciplinary course that will cover selected topics at the intersection of economics, operations research, and computer science. A recurring theme in the course will be how economic solution concepts are enabled at scale via AI and optimization methods. We will describe several successful practical applications, including how to:

* Make a poker AI
* Fairly allocate course seats to students, food to food banks, etc
* Protect wildlife or airports
* Conduct large-scale auctions for spectrum or Internet ads

### Course Structure

The course will be lecture-based, with Christian Kroer giving the lectures. At the end of the course there will be a few lectures of project presentations by students.

Readings will consist of a mixture of textbooks and course notes, which will be uploaded after lectures.

Students will complete a project, which may be done individually or in groups of 2-3 students. 

Grading will be as follows:

* 50% final project write-up
* 20% homework (there will only be 1-2 homeworks)
* 15% Final project presentation
* 10% Participation
* 5% Project proposal


### Outline
A rough outline is as follows:

* Intro to game theory and market design
* Nash equilibrium
  * Zero-sum games, minimax theorem
  * First-order methods/Online convex optimization/regret minimization in games
  * Deep learning for solving games at scale
  *	How the above is used in making superhuman poker AIs
* Security games
  * Stackelberg equilibrium
  * Basic Stackelberg security game model
  * Mixed-integer programming, deep learning for scaling up
  * Applications to airport, wildlife, power grid security
* Market design
  * Fisher markets and market equilibrium
  * Optimization methods for computing market equilibria
  * Machine learning methods for large markets
  * fair division, course allocation 
  * Internet ad auctions
  * Spectrum auctions

We will also cover some subset of the following:

* Matching markets
* Data science in multiagent systems
